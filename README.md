This is a small Flutter project about: A Weather Forecast App.

## Getting Started

A sleek and user-friendly weather forecasting app that provides real-time current, hourly, and 5-day daily forecasts.<br>

It fetches real-time data from the OpenWeather API, ensuring users get reliable weather information anytime, anywhere. It processes and visualizes meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions (e.g., rain, clear sky) using a clean, responsive UI.<br>
